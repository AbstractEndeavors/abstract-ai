The 'deployer.py' script serves as the main operational piece of this overarching Python tool. It extensively utilises libraries like 'PySimpleGUI', 'json', and 'os' for user interface, file I/O, and system operations, and coordinates interactions with the other scripts present in the module such as 'abstract_utilities', 'abstract_window_manager', and 'contractVariableManager' etc.

The first set of functions in this script are mainly for file reading, writing, and creation, to manage the large amount of data that is being extracted from the smart contracts. This is followed by multiple functions that deal with UI, like 'choose_files' and 'gui_input', which help in user interaction to select files and input textual data respectively.

The script contains a function 'existFoldCheck' that helps to check if folders and files exist or not before accessing them directly, reducing the probability of potential errors during the I/O process. Another notable function is 'get_syntax_info', it outlines the different elements of a Solidity smart contract such as visibility, modifiers, global variables, etc which may help to analyze the contracts.

Lastly, the script has the 'get_new_varis' function that appears to return a dictionary containing key information about the current deployment process, like 'count', 'files', 'fileNames', 'adds', 'currFilePaths', and so forth. This function can provide an understanding of the parameters and variables the script uses and maintains during its operation.

Overall, 'deployer.py' serves a critical function in extracting and managing data about smart contracts in an automated way, forming a major part of the main Python tool.
