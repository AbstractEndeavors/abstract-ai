This script extracts pragma solidity version information for a given Smart Contract. It is designed in Python and is part of a larger tool meant for automating Smart Contract deployment. The script called pragmaVariableManager has an important role in managing the pragma solidity versions for the Smart Contracts. It contains various functions that check, split, count, determine sections and convert pragma versions to different formats. The script reads the currrent working directory (os.getcwd()) and the path of the versions file (prags.py). It extracts and uses the versions to verify, manage, and align the versions with the correct Smart Contracts before their respective deployment process begins. The correlations and functionality between the extracted versions are well coordinated to ensure every Smart Contract fits into a specified range and deployment order.
