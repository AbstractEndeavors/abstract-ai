The seventh chunk of contractVariableManager.py is responsible for parsing various elements of a smart contract and structuring them for the automated deployment process. The functions parse contracts, interfaces, libraries, functions, constructors, and automate the process of saving relevant data of contract elements to the file based on their Solidity version. A key method here is 'getNames', which likely returns the names of smart contract components for further processing. Another one is 'importCheck', performing the necessary steps to verify if the required resources for the certain contract are available. Moreover, 'saveSect' and 'sendIfs' seem to play central roles in processing contract data and organizing it for deployment.

The eighth script, get_initial_variables.py, deals with gathering initial variables and other crucial pieces of information from a smart contract. Key methods are 'pragmaVerSplit', 'importCheck' and 'getInitialVars'. The latter manages various types of variables and handles data extraction for page directives, 'pragma solidity', and import statements. It works with specific data types but leaves room for flexibility with a 'random' category. Implicit checks for necessary resources are performed during the process. It carefully scans dependencies, reducing the risk of errors in the deployment process.

abstract_window_manager.py is a graphical user interface (GUI) manager script, helping manage windows, threads, and long-running operations. The 'GUIManager' class is central to this script, dealing with long-running operations - actual or simulated, managing threads for such operations, and controlling various aspects of GUI window events. It integrates with the main smart contract management tool, providing a layer of interactivity and a visual aspect to an otherwise console-driven system. The separation of GUI controls from contract management code boosts script readability and allows for stand-alone usage or easier updates to the GUI aspect of the tool.
