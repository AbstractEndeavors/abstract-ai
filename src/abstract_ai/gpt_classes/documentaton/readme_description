The script extracts necessary information from a smart contract for deployment. The information includes dependencies or imports which the contract needs, order of launching, syntax checks and more. Moreover, it organizes the extracted information neatly into a folder structure that is easy to access and understand. The extracted information includes `Functions.json` which is likely the file containing all the functions available in the contract, `info.json` which might have the contract's metadata, and `lineTrack.json` probably mapping each line of the contract code for easy debugging. Also, `script.sh` file might contain the launching or deployment script for the contract. The extraction of such information allows the contract to be deployed in an organized manner. This is especially useful when dealing with large or multiple contracts, as it reduces manual work and reduces the chance of errors.
